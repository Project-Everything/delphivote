# DelphiVote

Tired of boring vote rewards? Say hello to DelphiVote, the ultimate vote listening and reward management plugin that'll make your players actually excited to vote!

With DelphiVote, you're the boss of your server's voting strategy. Want to give out diamond pickaxes for every 5th vote? Done. How about a server-wide celebration when you hit 1000 total votes? Easy peasy. You can even set up randomized reward packages to keep things spicy! Our super flexible config lets you create any combo of items, commands, and messages you can dream up.

But wait, there's more! DelphiVote speaks your language (literally - we've got English, Spanish, and Portuguese built-in), works with both SQLite and MySQL, and even remembers offline votes so no one misses out. Plus, with [HeadDatabase](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/head-database.14280/) support, you can hand out cool custom heads as rewards.

So why settle for a plain old voting plugin when you can have a vote party with DelphiVote? Give it a spin and watch your server's vote count skyrocket! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰
